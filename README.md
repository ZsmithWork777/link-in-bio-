# Link in Bio – Zachary Smith

This is a link-in-bio page I built using straight HTML and CSS.

The goal was to create a clean, responsive landing space that highlights my main platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, X) and a few projects visually. No frameworks — just raw code and layout.

## What It Includes

- Avatar and name section  
- Social media icons linked to my real profiles  
- Custom link buttons with thumbnails  
- Mobile-friendly gradient background  

## How to View It

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser  
- Or launch in GitHub Codespaces for live preview
